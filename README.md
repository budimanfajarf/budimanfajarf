# ☕ Hi! I'm Budi :)

I'm a web developer from Bandung, Indonesia 👨‍💻

I've been 5 years in IT stuff and have been focused on web development for 3 years. 
I love to code, and more prefer to code in the backend, 
but I can do frontend too :)

Here my experience in some languages and frameworks, 
both in backend and frontend: 
[PHP](https://www.php.net/ "PHP"), 
[Laravel](https://laravel.com/ "Laravel"), 
[CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/ "CodeIgniter"), 
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript "JavaScript"), 
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ "Node.js"), 
[Express.js](http://expressjs.com/ "Express.js"), 
[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/ "Vue.js"), 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io "Hugo").
